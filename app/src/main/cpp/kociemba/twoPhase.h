 * param: maxDepth -
 * defines the maximal allowed maneuver length. For random cubes, a maxDepth of

 * of 20 it takes a few seconds on average to find a solution, but it may take
 * much longer for specific cubes.
 * param: timeOut -
 * defines the maximum computing time of the method in seconds.
 * If it does not returns: with a solution, it returns with an error code.
 * param: moves -

 * the list is cleared before adding the required moves to it. Otherwise, the list remains the same.
 * param: pattern -
 * the desired pattern definition string. The returned list of moves
 * can bring entered cube to this pattern (and not to the standard solved cube).
 * param: depth -
 * stores the total depth of the algorithm.
 * returns: the corresponding error code
